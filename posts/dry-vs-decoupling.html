      <p class="strapline">Understanding the difference between code which looks the same
      and code which is the same can save you a lot of stress in the future.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">In the begining things were DRY</h2>
      <p>
        DRY, also known as Don't Repeat Yourself, is a pretty basic programming principle
        which most programmers learn early on in their careers. It's very easy to pick up; if you
        have two or more bits of code that do the same thing, you should define that code in
        one place where it can be shared. This means that if you need to change the behaviour of
        the code, there's now only one place that you need to change it in. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Coupling</h2>
      <p>
        Software coupling is essentially a measure of how much bits of code in a system rely on
        each other. Each individual case of code relying on other code is called software dependancy.

        <p>
          An object depends on another object if, when one object changes, the other might
          be forced to change in turn

      <h2 class="h2">Context is important</h2>
      <p>I said above that DRY is easy to understand but I've seen it go wrong a lot. In my experience, the
      main cause of this has been a lack of understanding of context around the code being DRYed. Consider this
      example:</p>

      <code>
        def subtract_10_percent_from number
          number - (number * 0.1)
        end
      </code>

      <code>
        def calculate_tax
          ...
          subtract_10_percent_from number
          ...
        end
      </code>
