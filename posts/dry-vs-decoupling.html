      <h2 class="h2">In the begining things were DRY</h2>
      <p>
        DRY, also known as Don't Repeat Yourself, is a pretty basic programming principle
        which most programmers learn early on in their careers. It's very easy to pick up; if you
        have two or more bits of code that do the same thing, you should define that code in
        one place where it can be shared. This means that if you need to change the behaviour of
        the code, there's now only one place that you need to change it in. 
      </p>
      <code>some code</code>

      <h2 class="h2">Coupling</h2>
      <p>
        Software coupling is essentially a measure of how much bits of code in a system rely on
        each other. Each individual case of code relying on other code is called software dependancy.

        <p>
          An object depends on another object if, when one object changes, the other might
          be forced to change in turn
        </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Context is important</h2>
      <p>DRY is easy to understand but it's important to keep in mind that it is a software pattern and, like
      every other software pattern, must be used appropriately and not in every situation. Consider the
      following example:  </p>

      <p>You've just created a new email template which requires a date. You already have a helper which generates a date
      and that helper is used in a view. The format of the date in the helper is what you want, so you decide that you 
      should keep the code DRY and just use the helper instead of defining that date elsewhere.</p>
      <p>After a while, there's a requirement to change the date format in the email templates. This is when
      your code dependency kicks in. If you change the format of the date in the helper, it'll break the format in the views.
