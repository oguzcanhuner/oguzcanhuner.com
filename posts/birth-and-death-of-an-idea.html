      <h1 class="h1 centered">Birth and death of an idea</h1>
      <div class="strip thin mar-b-l"></div>

      <p>Last week I came up with three new ideas; one was a fitness app, the other was to do with recruitment and the last was about setting up a physical business in mexico. As I told my friends about these ideas, I would usually get one of two reactions. The less frequent reaction is that the person I was telling would be interested in the domain of the idea and possibly want to get involved in thinking about the idea. The much more common reaction is that the person's eyes will gloss over and they will give me an encouraging smile and say something like "that's really cool". I'll come back to how this makes me feel.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Why I think of ideas</h2>
      <p>You might not know me so it's difficult to get this across in writing, but I've always found myself to be a very emphatic person. I find it easy to put myself in somebody else's shoes and this has a big emotional toll on me. Emotion runs a lot of my life and depending on the type of emotion, it will either completely energise me or completely drain me. I find human relationships to be the most interesting thing that we can observe and often seek out those relationships with others, hoping to get something meaningful out of people. When I think of a business idea, all I'm trying to do is come up with another way that people can interact with each other or with themselves.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Where does it go wrong?</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">I have a tonne of ideas but nothing ever comes out of them. Why is that?
      
      <p class="mar-b">I think there are two things at play here.</p>
      
      <p class="mar-b">Firstly, I think that I gain something from every idea I have, even if it's a small something. An idea will usually send me into a frenzy of research and action, even if it's just for a day, and without noticing, I will have gained something from that.</p>
      
      <p class="mar-b">Secondly, and more importantly, I'm completely afraid of judgement and failure and my feelings of inadequacy just stop me in my tracks. Every idea I have ends up with some combination of:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>"This has been done better than I can do it, so I won't do it"</li>
        <li>"This probably won't work"</li>
        <li>"I dont think I'm good enough to do this"</li>
        <li>"This isn't even a good idea"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I'm sure that sometimes these reasons are true, but they can't always be true.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Why do I tell people about my ideas</h2>
      <p>Going back to the story above, you now probably have an idea of how it makes me feel when people have the second reaction to my ideas. Every time this happens, I confirm all of my insecurities and it only takes a few of those reactions for me to talk myself out of doing whatever it is that I wanted to do. When I think about it, I think it's a form of self destructive behaviour, but one that I'm used to so repeat all the time.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What will I do?</h2>
      <p>I'm in a position now where I understand my own shortcomings and I understand why I do things, even if I haven't got control of them. In an attempt to work through my issues, I'll be working toward the following things:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Understand my strengths and weaknesses</li>
        <li>Partner up with people who can compliment those</li>
        <li>Don't strive for perfection</li>
        <li>Be honest with yourself</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This blog post is a way for me to start being honest with myself. I know it's not perfect, it probably reads badly and might make you cringe, but that's the point. It's something and it's better than giving up.</p>
