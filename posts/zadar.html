      <p>This month I've been in Zadar, Croatia with a new group of people. It's actually been a really good month for me in terms of getting stuff done. It feels like one of those months where a lot has happened, but it goes by really quickly.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Tattoos</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">In my last post I wrote a bit about a tattoo website that I'm building with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jack_l_smith/">Jack</a>. Well, I've been making a lot of progress on that and honestly it feels great to actually be building something. We're building a tattoo search engine which will help people discover new tattoo styles and artists (and help them get their next tattoo). Part of creating the website is gathering a bunch of data about tattoo artists, which we've decided to do manually to begin with.</p>
      <p class="mar-b">I've started by creating a streamlined admin section for the website which allows us to quickly store information about tattoo artists and studios. As I've been collecting information, it's taught me a lot about where the relevant information lives on the internet and how to get that information as quickly as possible. Although it's tedious, I'm getting a lot of insights out of doing the collection manually.</p>
      <p class="mar-b">I've also been learning a lot about social media this month. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/outline.wtf/">Brittnee</a> created an Instagram account for me and I've been working on building out a social media presence (lol). It's only been running for a week and I'm on 250 followers (at the time of writing), which I'm pretty happy with. Since tattoos are a very visual medium, I'm hoping that social media will drive a lot of the traffic.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">T-shirts</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">At the start of the month I read a post about a guy who created a tshirt business in 24 hours (very clickbate-y, I know) and it got me thinking about whether I could do something similar. I suggested doing a brainstorm with the group and a bunch of us got involved in coming up with t-shirt themes. Within a few hours, we all came up with a dozen ideas and one that we would work on.</p>
      <p class="mar-b"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bond.miss.bond/">Brittnee</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/katy_kirby/">Katy</a> and I decided to partner up on one specific theme, urban yoga, and after about a week of work, we've got a brand, a store hooked up to a payment gateway and several shirt designs to begin with. We'll be writing more about the process soon but in the mean time you can view the store here.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Concentration</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">I'm still doing client work for 1-2 days a week since none of my other projects are making money yet. Part of my current challenge is to figure out how to prioritise the different bits of work that I'm doing and to make sure that I'm being productive instead of being busy. I do find it really hard to concentrate on my client work simply because I'm much more excited about the other stuff, but right now it's necessary. I'm hoping for my projects to start paying off (even if it's a tiny amount) by the start of next year.</p>
      <p>It feels like last month was all about planning and this month has been all about doing. I'm really happy with that flow right now :)</p>
