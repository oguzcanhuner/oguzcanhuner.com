      <p>At the moment I'm in Budapest, living with a group of entrepreneurs and remote workers, and it's given me the chance to learn from people who are at different stages in their lives and businesses, which I'm really grateful for. Yesterday we had a session where each person presented things that they are working on and would benefit from advice from. In this session, I described the tattoo business that I'm building and the advice that I got from the different range of people was extremely helpful but also very uncomfortable.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Knowing What to Build</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">I haven't built a startup before but understand a lot of the theory, from having worked at different startups and also from having read a lot of the books and online blogs around the subject. I know that one of the most important things you should do is really understand what your offering is, what problem you're solving and focus just on that. With that said, it's difficult to come to that conclusion and I think it's natural to evolve your idea in your mind, which results in you losing focus of that offering and problem.</p>
      <p>After I explained my business to people, one of the first questions I got back was "what's your focus?". I explained that the thing I'm building is a search engine but because the content for that engine isn't easy to get, my goal is to build a social network which would generate the content for the engine. In my mind this was a perfect couple and the two sides of the business would facilitate each other. The big feedback that I got was that the search engine was a very useful product but that the social network would be too hard to execute, and that I should think of ways to gather content manually.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Separating Real Life Considerations from Insecurities</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">Hearing that hit a nerve; one that I've come across many times before. Initially I only focused on the "it's too hard to execute" bit and tuned out from the rest of the explanation. I think everyone has a little voice in their head telling them that they can't do things, and when it's confirmed by a peer who you respect, it goes from being a little voice to being the only voice that you can hear.</p>
      
      <p class="mar-b">I've been doing a lot of self discovery recently and I was able to spot myself disconnecting from the conversation and so I pulled myself back in. When I did that, I realised that the advice that people were giving me wasn't actually anything to do with my ability to execute, but a cost-gain analysis of what I'm trying to build. They were simply suggesting that the cost of building a social network was too high to justify doing it as a secondary aspect of my business.</p>
      <p>After I got over that initial difficulty, I could start to separate my insecurities from the advice that was being given to me and get a much more objective view on the issue. I found myself really agreeing with what people were saying and realised that part of that was the experience that these people had, and part of it was that I've spent so long thinking about the product that it naturally evolved in my mind and slipped away from the core product that I had envisaged to begin with.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Moving Forward</h2>
      <p class="mar-b">I'm working on this business with a friend and we both discussed what I learned from that session and had a good discussion about how to move forward. We'll focus all our effort on manually collecting data on tattoo artists and slowly build up a database of artists. It's tedious but it's a known path and we can make steady progress which eliminates a lot of the unknowns associated with building a social network. Once we get enough data, the next step will be to build a simple but very user friendly interface to allow people to search for the artists in our database.</p>
      <p>That meeting was a big win for me, both from a business perspective but also from a personal perspective. Being able to separate my insecurities from my ideas allowed me to be much more open and receptive to advice and resulted in me feeling much more confident in what I was doing.</p>
