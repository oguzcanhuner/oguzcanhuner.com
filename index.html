      <p class="medium-margin">I'm a developer based in London, working mainly with Ruby and connected technologies.</p>
      <p class="medium-margin">I've had a bunch of experience with startups, both very early stage and mature. I try hard to write good, maintainable code,
      mainly to make my life easier but also to keep projects fast*.</p>
      <p class="medium-margin">I tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/oguzcanhuner">here</a> and sometimes code <a href="http://github.com/oguzcanhuner">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="note">* Easy to change code means a quicker response to business demands :)</p>
