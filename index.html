      <p class="medium-margin">I'm a developer based in London, working mainly with Ruby and connected technologies.</p>
      <p class="medium-margin">I have over 4 years of experience working with startups, both very early stage and mature. I try hard to write good, maintainable code,
      mainly to make my life easier but also to keep projects fast*.</p>
      <p class="medium-margin">I have spent the last year working solely on remote projects and would love to carry on doing that kind of work. I'm always keen on hearing about interesting projects; <a href="mailto:oguzcanhuner@gmail.com">email me</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/oguzcanhuner">message me on twitter</a> if you have something in mind. </p>
      <p class="medium-margin">You can find all of my public code here <a href="http://github.com/oguzcanhuner">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="note">* Easy to change code means a quicker response to business demands :)</p>

      <section class="medium-margin clearfix">
        <p ><a href="http://www.mastered.com">Mastered</a></p>
        <p>I helped pivot a product by leading a small team in taking an existing codebase and
        changing it as quickly as possible, while maintaining code quality. The company went on to get funded.</p>

        <p>I'm a massive nerd for old school games and one of my favourite ones is called Nethack. This project is my attempt at recreating a Nethack-like game in ruby (and having fun with it :) )</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/oguzcanhuner/eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a></p>
        <p>This is a gem that I wrote while I was at Lostmyname. I was doing a lot of work with Facebook Ads API and couldn't find any gems to do what I wanted, so I ended up writing an API wrapper with the functionality that I needed.</p>

        <p>After the marvel comics API was released, I spent a weekend hacking on a simple API wrapper in ruby and published it as a gem.</p>
