        I'm a software developer with five years experience of working on a range of projects from pre-launch startups to Google-backed companies. I have used
        both backend and frontend technology, with a heavier focus on writing scalable backend systems.

        Before starting my career, I studied Computer Science in beautiful North Wales where I completed
        a disertation on distributed AI systems. After that, I got engrossed in the world of web
        development, focusing on Ruby and the various web frameworks that went along with it (with
        rails being the most obvious one). I got the chance to work on some very high traffic rails
        websites and tackled many of the unique challenges that websites face at that scale.

        I maintain a number of open source libraries which you can view on <a href="https://github.com/oguzcanhuner">github</a> alongside
        all of my public code.

        When I'm not programming, I enjoy travelling the world, meeting new people and 
        boxing (a lifelong hobby of mine). I also hack on the odd nerdy 
        <a href="https://github.com/oguzcanhuner/roguelike">game</a> when I have time :)
